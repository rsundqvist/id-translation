.. _translation-logging:

Logging
=======
All messages are emitted by :mod:`id_translation` namespace loggers. The `id_translation` namespace uses the
``logging.WARNING`` log level (similar to
`SQLAlchemy <https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/14/core/engines.html#configuring-logging>`__).
To enable logs at the ``‚ÑπÔ∏è INFO`` level and below, you must explicitly configure the log level.

Verbose logging
---------------
Set the global :data:`~.logging.ENABLE_VERBOSE_LOGGING` flag (or use :func:`~.logging.enable_verbose_debug_messages`) to
enable additional ``ü™≤ DEBUG``-level messages. Use the :envvar:`ID_TRANSLATION_VERBOSE` variable in containers.

.. warning::

   Verbose logging may emit hundreds of messages for a single translation task!

Note that `verbose` and ``ü™≤ DEBUG`` logging are different things; verbose logging may emit hundreds of messages where
regular ``ü™≤ DEBUG`` might only emit a dozen.

Example
-------
The ``‚ÑπÔ∏è INFO``-level messages emitted for a single :meth:`.Translator.translate` class.

.. literalinclude:: dvdrental-info-messages.log
   :language: log

Since these are :ref:`üîë key event <Key Event Records>` messages, there are corresponding entry events. The
``'enter'``-records, however, are only emitted on the ``ü™≤ DEBUG`` level.

.. _key-events:

Key Event Records
-----------------
Key event messages are emitted at the boundaries of the various stages in the translation process (see the
:ref:`translation-primer` and :ref:`mapping-primer` pages). Common fields are listed below.

.. list-table:: Key Event Record Structure
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Field
     - Type
     - Description
   * - `task_id`
     - ``int``
     - Unique task identifier, e.g. for a single :meth:`~.Translator.translate` call.
   * - `event_key`
     - ``str`` = ``class.method:stage``
     - E.g. `MultiFetcher.fetch_all:enter` (where ``stage='enter'``).
   * - `seconds`
     - ``float``
     - Task duration in seconds. Only when ``stage='exit'``.

All key event methods add additional fields that are relevant to the current task and stage. Fields may be added,
removed, or change values depending on the ``stage`` of the event.

Event-specific fields
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Let's take closer look at the final message. The :class:`~logging.LogRecord` contains additional information that isn't
included in the message itself. The full ``Translator.translate:exit``-record is shown as JSON below.

.. literalinclude:: dvdrental-records.json

   :lines: 9726-9769
   :lineno-start: 9726

About 350 messages were emitted since ``ENABLE_VERBOSE_LOGGING=True``. If we were using regular ``ü™≤ DEBUG``-logging,
about 40 messages would have been emitted instead. The vast majority of the verbose messages relate to mapping and
fetcher initialization.

.. code-block:: python
   :caption: Dummy version of the code that produced the the records.

   from logging import basicConfig, DEBUG
   from id_translation import Translator
   from id_translation.logging import enable_verbose_debug_messages

   basicConfig(handlers=[SomeJsonExporter()])

   translator = Translator.from_config(main_config, [fetcher_configs..])
   with enable_verbose_debug_messages():
       translator.translate(df)

The configs that were used are available `here <examples/dvdrental/dvdrental.html#configuration-files>`_.
